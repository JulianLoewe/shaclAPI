- Evaluate Path from Target Shape to actual Shape
- Add whole shapes not unseen triples
- Set Variables properly (new ones!) <-> Ã¼berschneidungen mit Target Query (star shape query)
- Order by term with right variable

- Parse Initial Star Shaped Query correctly into CONSTRUCT Query e.g. ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET Terms
 --> DISTINCT isn't working correctly with ReducedShapeParser
