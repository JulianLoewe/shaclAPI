Done:
- Improved Logging -> But there are still some problems: Error Handling might be inconsistent, Threads Exceptions are not catched in the moment
- Post Processing is now non-blocking --> Basically the variables from the query are split into these which link to shapes and the rest.
                                      --> Now there is a Hashtable collecting results for ids (set of bindings)
				      --> Two threads one waiting for the joined validation results for the first set of variables
                                      --> The other one waits for the bindings for the rest of the variables

To be done:
- Single Processing really differs from the multiprocessig procedure this could be changed. --> This would make the Output Creation more obvious. !!!
- ReducedShapeParser only differ in function names this is really annoying and leads to duplicate code.
