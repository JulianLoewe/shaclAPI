- Parse Initial Star Shaped Query correctly into CONSTRUCT Query e.g. ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET Terms
- Autoretrieve Namespaces
- more then one filter --> slow down
- PrefixHandling: --> Example Prefixes extracted from the star shaped query should be added to the SPARQLPrefixHandler

- Allow all kind of FILTER's in star shaped queries. (tc1/test3)
- What to do with not unique identifiable shape given an incoming query?

- We only validate/invalidate the instances given by the star shaped query --> Option to return the rest of the instances as invalid?
